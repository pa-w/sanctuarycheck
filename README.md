SanctuaryCheck.org lets you check on whether your city, workplace, school, or place of worship is a place of sanctuary, i.e. it has adopted policies of protecting unauthorized immigrants by not prosecuting them for violating federal immigration laws and by ensuring that all residents have access to city services, regardless of immigration status.
